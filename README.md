### Hi there 👋  I'm Jay Cruz

I’m a Software Developer based in Orlando, FL. I write client and server-side JavaScript to build websites and web applications. The stacks I'm most experienced with are React with Node + Express with either Non-SQL or SQL DB's, but I can work with any JS library or framework you throw at me. I also dabble with Rust. 🦀
