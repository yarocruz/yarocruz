### Hi there 👋  I'm Jay Cruz

I’m a Software Engineer and my jam has been Web Development. My specialty has been in crafting user interfaces using React/Next.js and developing robust RESTful APIs with Node/Express with SQL databases. Beyond Web Development, I've been broadening my horizon by diving into languages like Python, Rust, and Golang, aiming to tackle unique software challenges across various aspects of technology.
