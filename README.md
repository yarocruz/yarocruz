### Hi there 👋  I'm Jay Cruz

I'm a Software Engineer based in Orlando, FL. My main focus has been in Web Development, but I'm interested in the broader world of Programming. I studied Graphic Design and specialized in Web Design. I also completed a "Full-Stack" JavaScript centered Coding Bootcamp. I did a short gig with a Startup as a Front-End Developer, worked in Tech Support for ServiceNow, and I'm currently a Teaching Assistant for the 2U/edX Coding Bootcamps.
